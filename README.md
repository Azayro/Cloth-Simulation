Cloth simulation using DirectX 11

Most of the files were provided as part of the foundations for the coursework set by the lecturer.

The following files are 100% mine:

Dx11 Mesh Porciessing/Cloth.cpp
Dx11 Mesh Porciessing/Cloth.h

Dx11 Mesh Porciessing/Resources/Shaders/cloth_anchors_cs
Dx11 Mesh Porciessing/Resources/Shaders/cloth_constraints_cs
Dx11 Mesh Porciessing/Resources/Shaders/cloth_forces_cs

Dx11 Mesh Porciessing/Resources/Shaders/superman.jpg - Used to texture the cloth

Modifications were also made to the main.cpp to call create and object of the cloth class to execute it.
